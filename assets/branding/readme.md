# Branding (2022-2024)
The branding system was implemented on November 25th 2022 with OpenSB Beta 3.0.0-003 (back when it was using the pre-Orange/pre-2023 versioning system). This allowed for OpenSB to not have hardcoded SquareBracket branding.

It should be noted that this system did not exist in Orange 1.0, and was only reimplemented in Orange 1.1.

Production-specific branding was excluded from the OpenSB repository until June 10th 2024, so this archive contains 3 reconstructed versions of sb_branding/qb_branding from the era. All dates referenced here are of their earliest known use.

* [Qobo](qb_branding) (November 25th 2022[^1]-July 21st 2023[^2])
* [squareBracket](sb_branding_2024-03-01) (March 1st 2024[^3]-April 14th 2024)
* [squareBracket](sb_branding_2024-04-14) (April 14th 2024-June 14th 2024)[^4]

[^1]: These date from prior to the branding system and are from September 14th/18th 2022.
[^2]: The Qobo branding was replaced with the default generic OpenSB branding due to the production instance being nuked by accident. This default branding likely remained on production until it was updated to use a near-final version of Orange 1.0 in October 2023 [proof](https://archive.ph/dGzrw). In my now-deleted DMs with the former co-owner, I told them "okay it's back but i don't have qobo branding files so it's just gonna use temporary opensb shit until i get a new fucking codebase".
[^3]: This branding was used in a test instance from March 1st. The wordmark logo was also used in the "Stay tuned" page.
